Audio Playback for Scales: Add a "Play" button for each scale diagram that plays the notes of the scale up and down. This immediately connects the visual pattern to the sound, which is essential for ear training.

Metronome Integration: Incorporate the metronome idea directly into the scale practice page. A user could set a BPM and practice playing the scale in time with a clicking track, helping them develop rhythm.

Simple Backing Tracks: For a given scale (e.g., A Minor Pentatonic), provide a simple, looping backing track of a relevant chord progression (like Am - G - C). This is the most effective way for a user to start feeling how a scale is used musically and to begin improvising.

Scale-Based Exercises: Instead of just showing the static pattern, you could highlight simple exercises. For example, a "Practice in Thirds" mode could light up the notes in a sequence (1st note, 3rd note, 2nd note, 4th note, etc.) for the user to follow. -->
