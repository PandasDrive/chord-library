Interactive Practice Tools
Audio Playback for Scales: Add a "Play" button for each scale diagram that plays the notes of the scale up and down. This immediately connects the visual pattern to the sound, which is essential for ear training.

Metronome Integration: Incorporate the metronome idea directly into the scale practice page. A user could set a BPM and practice playing the scale in time with a clicking track, helping them develop rhythm.

Simple Backing Tracks: For a given scale (e.g., A Minor Pentatonic), provide a simple, looping backing track of a relevant chord progression (like Am - G - C). This is the most effective way for a user to start feeling how a scale is used musically and to begin improvising.

Scale-Based Exercises: Instead of just showing the static pattern, you could highlight simple exercises. For example, a "Practice in Thirds" mode could light up the notes in a sequence (1st note, 3rd note, 2nd note, 4th note, etc.) for the user to follow. -->

<!--  Inigetrating Music Theory
"When to Use This Scale" Info: For each scale, add a small section with tips. For example, for the Minor Pentatonic, you could add: "Sounds great over blues, rock, and pop progressions in a minor key. Try it over an Am - G - C progression." This links your two main features (chords and scales) together.

Show Relative Major/Minor: When a user selects a major scale (like G Major), also show them its relative minor (E Minor), and vice-versa. This is a fundamental concept that helps users see the relationships between different keys and scales.

Introduce Modes: As a more advanced topic, for the Major Scale, you could add a selector for its different modes (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, etc.). This would reuse the same note patterns but highlight a different starting "root" note, explaining how this changes the mood of the scale. -->


<!-- Enhancing Visuals and Data
Multiple Scale Positions/Boxes: Right now, your data structure includes "box1" for the pentatonic scale. A great next step would be to add the data for all 5 standard "box" patterns for each scale. A user could then toggle between Box 1, Box 2, etc., to see how the scale connects all over the fretboard.

Key Transposition: Allow the user to select a key (like "A" or "G#") in addition to the scale type. The application would then dynamically shift the scale pattern up or down the fretboard to the correct starting position. This is crucial for making the patterns practical.

Highlighting Root Notes: In the diagrams, make the root notes of the scale a different color or shape. This is the most important note for a beginner to learn, as it anchors the entire pattern to the key.

Toggleable Note Names: Add an option to display the actual note names (e.g., A, C, D, E, G) on top of the dots in the diagram. This helps bridge the gap between the physical pattern and the underlying music theory. -->
